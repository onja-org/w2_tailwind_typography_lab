## üìã Project Overview

You'll build 5 different card types, each focusing on different responsive typography techniques. The instructions start with lots of guidance and gradually give you more independence as you progress.

1. **Basic Card** - Step-by-step, copy-paste, and class explanations
2. **Article Card** - Guided, but with some blanks for you to fill in
3. **Product Card** - Checklist and hints, less explicit code
4. **Profile Card** - High-level outline and requirements
5. **Card Grid** - Challenge prompt and success criteria only

## üõ†Ô∏è Section-by-Section Instructions

### Section 1: Basic Card (Full Guidance)

**Goal:** Create a simple card with a responsive title and description.

#### Step 1: Replace the placeholder content
Find this section in `index.html`:
```html
<section>
  ...
  <div class="bg-white rounded-lg shadow-md p-6">
    <!-- TODO: Add your basic card content here -->
    <p class="text-gray-500">Your card content will go here...</p>
  </div>
</section>
```
Delete the placeholder `<p>` and replace it with:

```html
<div class="text-center">
  <h3 class="text-lg sm:text-xl md:text-2xl lg:text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-3">
    Welcome to Our Platform
  </h3>
  <p class="text-sm sm:text-base md:text-lg text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
    Discover amazing features that scale beautifully across all devices. Our responsive design ensures the best experience on mobile, tablet, and desktop.
  </p>
</div>
```

#### Step 2: Understand the classes
- `text-lg sm:text-xl md:text-2xl lg:text-3xl`: The title gets bigger on larger screens
- `font-bold`: Makes the title bold
- `text-gray-900`: Dark gray text
- `mb-3`: Margin below the title
- `text-sm sm:text-base md:text-lg`: Description text size increases on larger screens
- `leading-relaxed`: More line height for readability
- `text-gray-600`: Lighter gray for the description
- `text-center`: Centers all text



#### Step 3: Save and test
- Save the file and open in your browser
- Resize the window to see the text size change

Here is an example of what section 1 will look like in both a bigger and smaller field of view.

### Section 2: Article Card (Partial Guidance)

**Goal:** Create a blog post card with proper typography hierarchy.

#### Step 1: Add the article title and date
Replace the placeholder with this structure:
```html
<article class="space-y-4">
  <h2 class="text-xl sm:text-2xl md:text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 leading-tight">
    The Future of Web Typography
  </h2>
  <p class="text-xs sm:text-sm text-gray-500 font-mono">
    Published on <time>December 15, 2024</time>
  </p>
  <!-- Add excerpt and tags below -->
</article>
```

#### Step 2: Add the excerpt
Below the date, add a paragraph with these classes:
- `text-sm sm:text-base md:text-lg` for responsive size
- `text-gray-700` for color
- `leading-relaxed` for line height

Example:
```html
<p class="text-sm sm:text-base md:text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
  Typography is the art and technique of arranging type to make written language legible, readable, and appealing when displayed.
</p>
```

#### Step 3: Add tags (your turn!)
- Use a flex container with `flex flex-wrap gap-2`
- Each tag: `text-xs uppercase tracking-wide font-semibold` and a color like `text-blue-600`
- Add at least two tags (e.g., Technology, Design)

#### Step 4: Save and test
- Save and check your work in the browser
- Make sure the text sizes and spacing change as you resize

Here is an example of what section 2 will look like in both a bigger and smaller field of view.
